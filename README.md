# Smart Loan Recovery System

A Machine Learning project that analyzes borrower profiles, predicts loan default risk, and assigns recovery strategies.  
This system helps financial institutions minimize loan losses through data-driven decision making.  

---

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – borrower income, loans, repayment patterns  
- Borrower Segmentation – clustering using KMeans  
- Default Risk Prediction – Random Forest classifier for high-risk borrowers  
- Dynamic Recovery Strategies – assigns actions based on predicted risk levels  

---

## Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas, Scikit-learn  
- Plotly (interactive visualizations)
